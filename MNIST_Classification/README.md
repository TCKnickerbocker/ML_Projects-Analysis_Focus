# MNIST Classification
<hr>
This notebook contains an ML project of mine wherein I ran classifiers against the MNIST digit dataset (a large dataset of integers representing pixel values on 28x28 images of hand-drawn digits). I utilized three different methods: a linear classifier, KNN, and a multi-layer perceptron and presented my results.
