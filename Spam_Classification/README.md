# 1-NN and NLP Methods for Spam Message Detection
<hr>
## Thomas Knickerbocker
This notebook contains an ML project of mine wherein I employ NLP methods such as term frequency vectorization to create spam classifiers, and compare their efficacy using different variants (stemming vs no stemming, 1-NN, and KMeans clusteiring for visual analysis). Results and visualizations are included within the notebook, and the dataset used is a labeled set of text messages provided to me by the University of Minnesota.
